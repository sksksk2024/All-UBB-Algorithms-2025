# ðŸš€ Algorithms & Problem-Solving Journey
- **[Course Projects]([course-folder](https://github.com/sksksk2024/sksksk-s-path-to-algorithms-mastery)/)** â€“ More algorithms from the courses I follow.

Over the past **two months**, Iâ€™ve **mastered** the essential algorithms and data structures needed for **university admissions, job interviews, and real-world problem-solving**. This repository is a collection of my **solutions, optimizations, and explorations** into various algorithmic challenges.  

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Covers**  
- **Backtracking & Recursion** â€“ Generating **permutations, subsets, partitions**, and solving combinatorial problems.  
- **Graph Algorithms** â€“ **BFS, DFS, Leeâ€™s Algorithm, Flood Fill**, and more.  
- **Dynamic Programming** â€“ **Optimized solutions** for complex recursive problems.  
- **Sorting & Searching** â€“ Classic and advanced **techniques** for efficient data handling.  
- **Mathematical Algorithms** â€“ **Number theory, factorial optimizations, combinatorics**.  

## ðŸ’¡ **Why I Built This**  
This project is not just a collection of algorithmsâ€”it's a **testament** to my **growth** in **logical thinking, speed, and efficiency**. By working on these problems, I:  
âœ… **Prepared** for university entrance exams with confidence.  
âœ… **Sharpened** my problem-solving skills for **coding interviews**.  
âœ… **Built a strong foundation** for real-world **development challenges**.  

## ðŸ”¥ **Whatâ€™s Next?**  
Now that Iâ€™ve **mastered algorithmic thinking**, Iâ€™m shifting focus back to **web development**â€”harnessing the power of my problem-solving skills to build **efficient, scalable, and optimized** applications.  

## ðŸ“Œ **How to Use This Repo**  
Feel free to **explore, contribute**, or use these implementations as a **learning resource**. Each algorithm is implemented in **JavaScript**, with clear logic and comments for easy understanding.
